I was already excited for this class before starting. As I read and watched the texts for the week last week and engaged with today's seminar, I am becoming even more aware of my passion for creating and engaging with works through digital pathways. I'm very curious about digital access and dissemination. How do we choose to create, display and make dialogue with audiences, both digitally and physically (utilizing digital methods). 

I'm apprehensive about feeling overconfident due to my perceived competence in the technical, even without the reasons behind it (Why am I choosing this tool over another? Is it actually useful/efficient/best choice, or is it something I'm comfortable/familiar with). 

I appreciate the diversity of thoughts in this room and how much synergy there is because of this. Maybe it is the nature of grad school, however, I feel very much reintegrated and intellectually stimulated compared to that of my master's program and working in professional environments. 

~ Perhaps that's the Vyvanse kicking in and me having a flexible structure that was lacking for a time. ~

As you can probably already tell, I am very excited and tend to get very externally expressive about it through discussions and other forms. If you feel like I'm stepping on your toes or anything, just give me a shout or anything as I'm probably not cognizant of it. I also have auditory processing issues, so I may ask you to repeat items (it's ok if it's not exactly verbatim). Usually, it's just one or two words missing that make my brain glitch (expect a letter from DRC soon:alt + 0153:  depending on how long it takes them to process CA/NY/PA paperwork over 20 years).

I appreciate the traveling/walking metaphors! Thank you for being candid and sharing with us! I'll probably be pestering you a lot!
