This database looks at how language policies either expand or resrict language access. Attempts are made to try and show the methods of access these policies address and the timeline for their potential enactment from date authored. Currently the data mostly reflects policies at the federal and state level with an emphasis on California and its municipalities. Eventually this will be expanded to include more data from other states. My goal is to use this data to compare the impacts of different models of addressing access for languages in languages other than English. My hope is to see if (in the case of positive results) similar effects could be achieved when applied to non-standard or vernacular English (following the pedagogical method of treating these as languages that are translated to standard english).
